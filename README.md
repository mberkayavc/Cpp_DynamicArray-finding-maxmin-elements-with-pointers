# Cpp_DynamicArray-finding-maxmin-elements-with-pointers
 A simple C++ program that dynamically allocates memory for an array, takes user input to populate the array, and uses pointers to find and display the largest and smallest elements along with their indices.

 # Dynamic Array: Finding Largest and Smallest Element with Pointers in C++

This project demonstrates how to dynamically allocate memory for an array in C++ using pointers. The program prompts the user to input integers into the array and then finds both the largest and smallest elements, along with their respective indices, using pointer arithmetic.

## Features
- Dynamically allocates memory for an array based on user input.
- Finds the largest and smallest integers in the array using pointers.
- Displays the values and their respective indices.
- Utilizes manual memory management with `new` and `delete[]`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and pointers
